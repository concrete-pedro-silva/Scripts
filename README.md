### Getting Started

#### What is Docker?

**Docker** is the company driving the container movement and the only container platform provider to address every application across the hybrid cloud. Todayâ€™s businesses are under pressure to digitally transform but are constrained by existing applications and infrastructure while rationalizing and increasingly diverse portfolio of clouds, datacenters and application architectures. Docker enables true independence between applications and infrastructure and developers and IT ops to unlock their potential and creates a model for better collaboration and innovation.

### Step 1
#### Installation

**NOTE:** we will do everything as root to make things easier as we are working with VM to learn, but do not do this in a real environment.
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/concrete-renato-ruis/markdown/master/install.sh | sh
```

If you see this message, then it worked! =)
